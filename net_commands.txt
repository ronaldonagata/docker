# Docker automatically create a network called bridge, with the bridge driver. 
# When you instantiate a container and you don't specify the network, 
# the container will belong to the default bridge network  

# Any containers on the same network may communicate with one another via IP addresses. 
# Docker does not support automatic service discovery on bridge. You must connect containers 
# with the --link option in your docker run command.

# Driver None
# This offers a container-specific network stack that lacks a network interface.
# This container only has a local loopback interface (i.e., no external network interface).

# Driver Host
# This enables a container to attach to your hostâ€™s network (meaning the configuration inside 
# the container matches the configuration outside the container).


#View the docker networks
docker network ls

#Inspect network
docker network inspect <network>
